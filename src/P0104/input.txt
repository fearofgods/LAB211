Timeline is the newest Facebook user interface. It is designed so that users would see what the other user is doing by looking at their timeline user page. It was made for more fun and to share with the rest of the world what you are up to. Its release date was sometime in March 2012. Firstly the timeline profile was optional. In other words users can choose between traditional profile and the timeline. But recently Facebook announced that it would be compulsory for everyone to use timeline profile. "Timeline is rolling out over the next few weeks to everyone, all 800 million users, and once you have it, you have 7 days to change it up â€” but there is no escaping it."- said Facebook. The idea of timeline raised a big debate whether it is useful or it is a bad idea.
